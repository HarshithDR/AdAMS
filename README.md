## Architecture

1. **Driver Drowsiness Detection**:
- A camera captures the driverâ€™s face, and the system uses computer vision to analyze facial features.
- Detects signs of fatigue, such as yawning, eye closure, or head-nodding patterns.

2. **Vehicle Data Collection**:
- IoT sensors collect data from vehicle subsystems, such as engine performance and tire pressure.

3. **Backend Processing**:
- Data is processed and analyzed in real-time using the backend framework (Flask/Django).

4. **Frontend & Dashboard**:
- Displays real-time metrics and drowsiness alerts to users.
